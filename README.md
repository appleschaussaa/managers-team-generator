### What I learned

This was a very difficult challenge as it built upon an alright hard challenge from last week. It did help me impliment some of the things I learned since that last one and reminders for when I go back and redo challenge 9
​
### Continued development
​
Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

I need to figure out how to get all the role specific question responses to appear (office number, github and school) as I could only get it for the manager as well as fully implement how to add more than just one email.
​
### Useful resources
​
- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects) - Kinda forgot all the object that javascript uses so this helped
- [Example resource 2](https://medium.com/@mandeepkaur1/a-list-of-javascript-array-methods-145d09dd19a0) - helped with the method parts
- [Example resource 3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators) - Was a nice reminder
- [Example resource 4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer#examples) - Another nice little reminder

## Acknowledgments
​
As always I would like to thank Shane and all the TAs for a great job teaching and helping during class and breakout rooms. I would also like to make a shout out to Justin for helping me before class on the last project that unfortunately I did not fully grasp in time for challenge 9 but was able to get it in time for this one. Also the feedback from the challenge 9 grader built upon his help.
